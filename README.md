### Overview
Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is a novel treatment for cancer, and more recently, autoimmunity. T cells of the adaptive immune system are engineered to give them the ability to target a particular antigen (a protein) of the body. The word “chimeric” is used since the engineered receptor has both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions. CAR-T therapy is generally a 6-step process: leukapheresis, T cell isolation, CAR gene transduction, CAR-T cell expansion, lymphodepletion, and infusion.

Leukapheresis is the process of separating white blood cells (WBCs) from the blood of a patient. After this, T cells are isolated from the WBCs usually by CD3 magnetic beads. CD3 is a protein expressed on the surface of T cells and these beads are able to bind to CD3 allowing for the separation using a magnet.

The CAR construct is introduced into the isolated T cells by transfecting them with a retrovirus, typically a lentiviral vector. This viral vector contains the gene which encodes for the chimeric antigen receptor that the T cells utilize to recognize and attack their target. The vector is able to incorporate the gene into the genome of the T cell, which allows for expression of the CAR protein. When the CAR protein is made inside the T cell, it is then naturally brought to the surface of the cell so that it can interact with its target antigen.

The CAR protein itself needs to have at least 5 main components: the single-chain variable fragment (scFv), the hinge region, the transmembrane domain, a costimulatory domain, and the intracellular signaling domain. The scFv is the part of the protein that recognizes and binds to the specific antigen. The hinge region provides flexibility to the CAR protein, allowing it to move and bind to the antigen more efficiently. The transmembrane domain anchors the CAR protein to the surface of the T cell membrane. The co-stimulatory domain helps the T cell become activated when the scFv binds to its antigen, and there are several types, including CD28, 4-1BB, CD137, CD127, and OX40. This can impact the potency and durability of the CAR-T. There can also be multiple costimulatory domains as part of the CAR construct. Finally, the intracellular signaling domain, almost always CD3ζ, initiates the signaling cascade that makes the T cell ultimately activate and either kill its target or release cytokines. Over time, several generations of CAR constructs have been developed.

The transfected T cells containing the CAR gene are then expanded ex vivo. This is typically done by stimulating the CD3 and CD28 domains on the T cell, causing them to activate and proliferate while also exposing them to growth-promoting cytokines. These cytokines include IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. 

Once enough T cells are expanded, they are infused back into the patient so that they can recognize and target the cells, typically B cells, for death. The CAR-T cells will bind to the cell and, either directly kill the cell via cytotoxic effects (like granzyme B), or release cytokines, recruiting other components of the patient’s immune system to effectively destroy them. This leads to the desired outcome of either a reduction in cancer or mitigation of autoimmune diseases, improving the patient's condition and quality of life.
